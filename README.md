**Helpful Prompt**:

- The main prompt that I gave to chatgpt:
```
Hi chatgpt, 

You are a senior software developer of around 5+ years of experience is developing scalable and full stack products. You are having good amount of experience in Typescript, React Js, Nest Js, SQL.
You design and implement systems as per given project requirements.

Please give me a detailed implementation plan for the below given project specifications.

Overview:
Build a simple sensor data dashboard that demonstrates your full-stack development skills.

The Challenge:
Create a web application for monitoring sensor readings from agricultural IoT devices.

Core Requirements:

Backend (REST API)

1. Endpoints to implement:
    - `POST /api/readings` - Submit a new sensor reading
    - `GET /api/readings` - Get all readings (last 24 hours)
    - `GET /api/readings/latest` - Get the most recent reading for each device

2. Simplified Data Model:
    
    ```json
    {  "deviceId": "GH001",  "timestamp": "2024-03-15T10:30:00Z",  "nitrogen": 150.5,  "phosphorus": 45.2,  "ph": 6.5}
    ```
    
3. Requirements:
    - Basic input validation (reasonable ranges for values)
    - Error handling with appropriate status codes
    - Use any database (SQLite is fine)
    - No authentication needed

4. Stack to use:
     - Use Nest Js for endpoints (Typescript language)
     - SQLite for DB (SQL language)

Frontend (Dashboard)

1. Components to build:
    - Dashboard showing latest reading from each device in a table or cards
    - Simple line chart showing nitrogen levels over time (last 24 hours)
    - Form to manually add a new reading
    - Alert banner when nitrogen exceeds 200 or ph is outside 6.0-7.0 range

2. Requirements:
    - Use React, React query for fetching apis, 
    - Basic styling (use scss)
    - Show loading states
    - Display API errors to user

3. React conventions to follow:
    1. **Structure**: Feature-based folders (`/features/readings/...`), keep files small.
    2. **Naming**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for vars/functions, CONSTANT\_CASE for constants.
    3. **Components**: Small, reusable, functional. Split UI (dumb) vs logic (container).
    4. **State**: Use React Query for server state, custom hooks for shared logic.
    5. **UI States**: Always handle loading, error, empty explicitly.
    6. **Styling**: Stick to one system (Tailwind / CSS Modules / Styled). Be consistent.
    7. **TypeScript**: Strong typing, no `any`, define prop interfaces.
    8. **API**: Centralize API calls in `/api`, handle errors globally.
    9. **Testing**: Use Jest + React Testing Library, test critical flows.
    10. **Quality**: ESLint + Prettier + strict TS, absolute imports, use git hooks.
    11. **Performance**: Use keys in lists, React.memo for pure UI, lazy loading for big chunks.

Sample Data Creation
    - Include at least 5-10 sample readings in your database/seed file
    - Cover at least 2 different device IDs

Evaluate proposed plan based on the following criteria:
1. Functionality
    - Does it meet the requirements?
    - Do frontend and backend work together?

2. Code Quality
    - Clean, readable code
    - Appropriate patterns for the scope
    - Error handling

4. Documentation
    - Can we run your project easily?
    - Clear about decisions and trade-offs

Please give me a detailed plan of implementation for it.
    1. I want to have the frontend and backend in a monorepo which is easy to start and test.
    2. Stack for development -  
         - Frontend -> ReactJs, React Query
         - Backend -> NestJs, NodeJs, SQL
         - Language -> Typescript.
    3. Plan a folder structure and for building the project will have Lerna.  
    4. Make sure to follow react and typescript coding standards. 

```
**AI Fix**:
- Css issues: Design issues, padding, width heights of the components
- Endpoint objective: Some endpoints were not behaving as expected, which need manual intervention
- for ex, /readings api was having a bad exception error due to endpoint parameters we having conflicting types
- Component names: Renamed some components for better understanding
- Had to fix some Lerna dependency issues, package.json config issues
